# Who/What are the Darkitechts?

We are programmers who think to ourselves, "Wouldn't it be great if ____ existed?" then actually create it. We don't ask for anything in return.

## What We Do

* Read code
* Write code

## Current Members

* @defuse
* @joepie91
* @sarciszewski

## Organization

Meritocratic Anarchy. Do what you want, ideas that individuals like (a purely subjective metric, of course) will end up getting more support from your peers.

## Membership Requirements

Nothing formal. Though, being able to program in at least one language would be helpful. If you're a blackhat, please compartmentalize those activities from the persona that interacts with us.
